              Growing up, my passions were all over the place. I tried alot of things but I knew for sure I had to be in the science industry doing something. During my long senior six vacation amidst covid lockdown, I got to learn about web development and safe to say my mind was made up shortly after. I applied for Computer Science at University where my skills were broadened beyond web development into app development,database managment, machine learning, computer networking to mention but afew. I have since developed projects as you will see.

                    I leverage figma-a cutting edge design tool to create intuitive interfaces for websites and apps as well as to design engaging fliers. My process involves meticulous attention to detail from conceptualixation to final design ensuring that each product i creat is not noly aethesitcally pleasing but also provides an intuitive user experience. This allows me to bring concepts to life with effieciency.

                  <p>
                   My proficiency in flutter allows me to develop mobile applications that are both aethesitcally pleasing and functionally robust. These apps are built with real-time syncing with firestore and tailored to provide cohesive experience across devices. Complementing my app development skills, I also specialise in javascript, python and django for web development. This enables me to construct dynamic and scalable websites with a focus on backend effieciency.
