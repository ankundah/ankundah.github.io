        <h2>About me</h2>
        <p> Growing up, my passions were all over the place. I tried alot of things but I knew for sure I had to be in the science industry doing something. During my long senior six vacation amidst covid lockdown, I got to learn about web development and safe to say my mind was made up shortly after. I applied for Computer Science at University where my skills were broadened beyond web development into app development,database managment, machine learning, computer networking to mention but afew. I have since developed projects that showcase all the hardwork and passion i have put to build my career.</p>
